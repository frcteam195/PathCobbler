cp code has its own copies of trans2d, rotate2d, and pose2d
- these are used to create real waypoints which are then
  sent to the java as json
- the json is parsed and the splines are calculated and returned as json

TODO:
the c wrapper should have a struct to define a simple waypoint
- the real waypoints will be constructed in the c code
- it will do the hard math then deconscruct the real waypoints
  into simple waypoints for the python to display
- simple waypoints need timestamp?
